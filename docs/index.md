# ChemCuration 2019

ChemCuration is a a one day, online-only conference around data curation and curated data in the
domain of chemistry. Inspired by BioCuration and by other online conferences, this year will mark
the first edition of a Twitter-based online poster conference. During the day, you will tweet your
poster with the meeting hashtag and respond to questions about the poster in the 24 hours after
your tweet. The poster must be available in an online repository (e.g. Zenodo or Figshare)
under the CC-BY or CC-BY-SA license.

The meeting scope: anything around data curation and curated data of *open science* data in
chemistry. This includes but is not limited to:

* a new release of curated open data
* FAIR metadata around open data
* open source tools for data curation

## Date and Venue

ChemCuration 2019 will take place in November or December this year. 

## Abstract Submission

Abstract submission is being worked out, but basically will be submitting a 
[Markdown]() file roughly reflecting one A4 page max. It may include hyperlinks
and graphics.

The submission will take place via a pull request, which may be a formal pull
request via GitHub, or by email (address will follow).

A review board will look at the abstract and approve it, reject it, or ask for
small changes.

ChemCuration ([#chemcur2019](https://twitter.com/hashtag/chemcur2019))
is a a one day, online-only conference around data curation and curated data in the
domain of chemistry. Inspired by BioCuration and by other online conferences, this year will mark
the first edition of a Twitter-based online poster conference. During the day, you will tweet your
poster with the meeting hashtag and respond to questions about the poster in the 24 hours after
your tweet. The poster must be available in an online repository (e.g. Zenodo or Figshare)
under the CCZero, CC-BY or CC-BY-SA license.

The meeting scope: anything around data curation and curated data of *open science* data in
chemistry. This includes but is not limited to:

* a new release of curated open data
* FAIR metadata around open data
* open source tools for data curation

## Date and Venue

ChemCuration 2019 will take place in on Tuesday December 3 this year. Posters will be posted and

## Abstract Submission

### How do I participate in ChemCuration?
You can participate in this online poster conference by presenting your poster on Twitter during the conference
day. You do this by first archiving your poster via [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) or [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/),
with an open license (e.g. CCZero or CC-BY). Then, during the day you tweet an image of (part of)
your digital poster with the [#chemcur2019](https://twitter.com/hashtag/chemcur2019) hashtag, a short summary, and a
link to your online poster with its DOI. The archived poster should be a regular A0 poster (WxH = 841 x 1189 mm or
33.1 x 46.8 in)

### Do I need to register?
Registration is not obligatory to participate. However, if you would like to be eligible for a poster prize, then 
registration before November 30, 23:59 GMT is required ([registration form](https://github.com/chemcuration/chemcuration2019/issues/new/choose)). Posters tweeted after this deadline are not
eligible for a poster prize.
